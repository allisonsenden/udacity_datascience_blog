This is a closer look into a dataset about Seattle's Airbnb market. It contains information from 2017 regarding the available airbnb's, their ratings, price, host information and more. 

The packages used were numpy, pandas, Counter, seaborn, model_selection package, linear_regression, and R2_score.

You will find here my notebook explaining the results and data cleaning strategies that went into this investigation. You can also download the seattle.zip file to view the raw data if you please.
